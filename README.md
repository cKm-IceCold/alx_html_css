🧠 Overview

The Headphones Website is a simple, elegant webpage that highlights a hero section with a call-to-action button, navigation links, and a short description.
It’s designed to look great on both desktop and mobile screens, adapting seamlessly using CSS media queries.

🛠️ Built With

HTML5 — Semantic structure and clean markup

CSS3 — Styling, layout, and responsive design

Flexbox — Used for aligning elements

Media Queries — For responsive adjustments

Google Fonts — Source Sans Pro for modern typography

🎯 Skills Tested
Skill Area	Description
HTML Structure	Use of semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <p>
CSS Layouts	Implementing Flexbox for responsive alignment
Styling & Theming	Applying background images, colors, hover effects, and button styles
Responsiveness	Adapting layout for mobile devices using media queries
CSS-Only Interactivity	Creating a hamburger menu toggle without JavaScript
📱 Responsive Behavior

Mobile View:
The navigation bar is replaced with a hamburger menu icon.
When tapped, the menu expands to show navigation links — powered by CSS only (using the checkbox hack).

💡 How It Works

The hero section uses a full-screen background image with centered text and button.

The header layout is controlled with Flexbox for proper spacing between the logo and navigation.

On smaller screens, media queries:

Hide the navigation links

Display a hamburger menu icon

Reveal the nav when the icon (checkbox) is toggled

All of this is done using only HTML and CSS — no JavaScript needed.

🧩 Future Enhancements

Add smooth scrolling to navigation links

Include more sections (like “What We Do” and “Contact Us”)

Improve the mobile menu animation

Add JavaScript for interactivity and transitions
